# Transaction Processing Systems - Patient Registration Form

This project was created as part of my Master's program during the Fall 2024 semester for the class **Transaction Processing Systems**. The assignment was to create a mock patient registration form that validates and stores data using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **HTML**: Structured patient registration form with multiple input fields.
- **CSS**: Styling for form elements and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Used for dynamic form validation and data storage.
- **Images**: Included a banner and logo for the webpage.
